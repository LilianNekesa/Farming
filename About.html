<h1> Company Story</h1>

<p> The idea of founding FARMICON came along after we identified a market gap betwen cabbage farmers and consumers. We have been practicing large scale farming for over 10 years. But, the problem always came about during the peak harvesting season. When growing cabbages, there is timing, but during this period, the market is always overflooded. </p>
    <p> So, we thought to ourself and said, why not start a marketplace so that there is no peak season?
   </p>
        <p> <br>And that is how we came up with FARMICON Marketplace. No more waiting for peak season to get cabbage in large scale. The availability of the vegetable is availabel whenever needed. </p>
</p>
    <h2> Mission</h2>
    <p> Our mission is to ensure consumers get cabbages whenever they need it in both large and small scale quantities all year round.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Engage communities in large scale farming and create more job opportunities through agriculture.

            <h2> Quality Assurance</h2>
          <p>  We have put the best organic farming practices in place to ensure that all the nutrients are included. Some of these nutrients include;
            <ul>
                <li> Decomposed compost</li>
                <li> Fish meal</li>
                <li>Bat Guano</li>
                <li> Worm Castings</li>
                <li> Blood meal</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Community Involvements</h2>
                <p>We have been running a Farmers Choice initiative to teach on how to grow cabbage organically. Though most farmers focus on only adding organic fertilizer for growth, its time they leearn other nutrients to that flourish cabbage. Still, through this initiative we strive to achieve our vision which we are few steps away to achieving. We are even seeking partnerships with edication institutions to train farmers on different cabbage variaties and nutrients they can use to maximize there produce.</p>
